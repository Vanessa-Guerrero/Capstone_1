# Capstone_1

This is my Capstone folder that includes all my files relating to my capstone 1 project. It revolves around my business idea on creating a Pet Care Services in Chicago, with plans to expand to other states. The shop will offer pet care services ranging from grooming, boarding, training, and walking for dogs and cats.

I pulled a dataset from WorldPopulationReview.com that detailed in each state how many people had dogs and cats in their households.
I also used a dataset from google trends showing the popularity score of people in Chicago searching for dog groomers for the past 12 months.
I used that information to show that there's a need of pet care service business in any state and that Chicago is a good starting place. Both data sets are in this folder.

I'm also storing in this folder my diagram in Drawio to show entity relationships in my model, Sql files that details on how I created my database and the sample data for my database.
